# A simple BCH error correction tutorial (Python)

In this repository, we provide a simple tutorial of BCH error correction with python.

This tutorial shows (1) how to transpose bit-string (generated by Numpy) to btyearray, and vice versa. (2) and how to en/decode the bytearray with BCH module. 

To show the error correction, we insert noise between the encoding and decoding procedure, by changing some bits to 1.
Even though some noise exists, the bch module sucessfully correct the errors.
